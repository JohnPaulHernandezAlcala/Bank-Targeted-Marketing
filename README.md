## Description 
This project uses a data derived method for predicting which client type should be targeted for successful bank telemarketing. A presentation that investigates which client features affect marketing success rate and machine learning methods result in a high F1 score, recall score, and AUC.



## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/Bank-Targeted-Marketing/blob/master/BankTargetedMarketing.ipynb) for navigation and a breakdown of the analysis process.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentation, [Bank Targeted Marketing](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/House_Sale_Prices/blob/master/House%20Price%20Analysis%20%26%20Insights.pdf).

## Conclusion
With all the features, we built a model with random forest classification. This model was evaluated for performance and found to have a recall of 56%, f score of 51%, and AUC of 0.79. Wither our model, we can identify top ten features that drive our model.
