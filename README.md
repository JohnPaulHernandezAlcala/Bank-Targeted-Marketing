## Description 
This project uses a data derived method for predicting which client type should be targeted for successful bank telemarketing. A presentation that investigates which client features affect marketing success rate and machine learning methods result in a high prediction accuracy and precision.



## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Table of Content](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/House_Sale_Prices/blob/master/Table%20of%20Content.ipynb) for navigation and a breakdown of the analysis process.
NOTE: For full navigation abilities, open up Table of Content in Jupyter Notebook.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentation, [House Price Analysis & Insights](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/House_Sale_Prices/blob/master/House%20Price%20Analysis%20%26%20Insights.pdf).

## Conclusion
With all the features, we built a model with multiple linear regression. This model was evaluated for performance and found to have an accuracy of 83.45% and a high precision (low error). Because of the high accuracy and precision of this model, we can identify three concrete features (also known as coefficients) that highly influence housing prices: Bathrooms, Grade and Zip Code.

## Recommended Uses for the Model:
* Allows housing developments to see which features in houses will see higher, lower, or negligible effects on house price based on model coefficients.
* Allows sellers to accurately and precisely place prices on houses
* Allows placements of houses with specific features in specific budget ranges for buyers
